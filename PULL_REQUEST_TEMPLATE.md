# **PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE**
---

## Title
The title should be a clear description in a couple of words what did you do and why did you do it. <br>
To further ease our work you could add a tag in front of the title. For example [FIX] or [ADDITION], but you may create your own if you so desire

## Description
The description is for further clarification of the additions or fixes.

## Labels and further information
One of the reviewers must always be the leader of the team [Tsvetelin][1] and you may assign as many as you want but not too much.
You can assign anyone to the pull request but it's a good idea to be one of the team.
The pull request should be properly labeled and if it accomplishes/helps accomplish a project goal it should also be noted. 
Also if it is a response to an issue it should be noted as well by linking it.
